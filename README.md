# Subject
You must recode the printf function from the C library according to the C99 standard. 

Your function shouldbe prototyped like the printf function.

You do not have to implement the C library printf buffer handling.

You must process all printf formating flags except the following (which are optional):
* float or double types management,
* %n flag management,
* " * " , " ’ " and " I " (capital i) flags management.

You must add a %b formating flag, which prints unsigned numbers in a binary base.

You must also add a %S formating flag, which prints a character string (like %s). 

However, non-printable characters (ASCII value strictly smaller than 32 or greater or equal than 127) must be represented by a back-slash to be followed by the character’s value in octal base.
